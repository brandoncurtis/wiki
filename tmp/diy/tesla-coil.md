Coating the Secondary
---------------------

From [4HV: Secondary Coil Coating/Varnish Type](http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?135123.0#post_135452):

> There's no varnish that can provide the thickness, ruggedness, insulation capabilities and appearance that can be obtained with a single coat of two-part clear epoxy. Done carefully, the finished secondary will look like it's encased in a glass sleeve. Over the past 10 years I've coated secondary coils of many different sizes with epoxy, and I'd NEVER go back to varnish.

Advice on epoxy selection and application techniques are available in [4HV: Clear epoxy secondary coating](http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?125009.0#post_125045).
