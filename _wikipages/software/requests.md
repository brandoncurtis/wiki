### Overview

This is a list of tools that I'd like to have and things that I'd like to know how to do.  I'm looking for suggestions, so [contact me](https://www.brandoncurtis.com/contact) if you have ideas!  My hope is that I will be able to build my own solutions as my programming skills complete.

### Request 0001 - workspace to workspace multi-window mover

Hotkey combination to move all of the windows in a given workspace to another workspace.  Works under Unity 7 in Ubuntu 16.04.

### Request 0002 - Unix CLI app for searching contact info

I want to pop open a terminal and quickly grab peoples' contact info. Should support importing data from the CSV produced by Google Contacts.

### Request 0003 - Unix CLI app for searching unicode codepoints

I use Unicode symbol insertion frequently, so I want to pop open a terminal and quickly grab the hex code for a given unicode symbol.
