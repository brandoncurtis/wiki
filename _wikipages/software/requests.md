### Overview

This is a list of tools that I'd like to have and things that I'd like to know how to do.  I'm looking for suggestions, so [contact me](https://www.brandoncurtis.com/contact) if you have ideas!  My hope is that I will be able to build my own solutions as my programming skills complete.
