Kefir Culture Conditions
------------------------

**\[dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1471-0307.2003.00104.x Influence of different culturing conditions on kefir grain increase\]**

Abstract:

> Kefir grains are the natural starter used during kefir production. Factors influencing grain increase—incubation temperature of 18, 22, 25 or 30°C, enrichment with combinations of tryptose (20 g/L) and yeast extract (20 g/L), and cultivation with and without agitation—were studied to develop a method for mass grain production. The highest grain increase (582%) was found with activated grains cultivated with agitation at 25°C in low-fat milk containing tryptose and replacing the fermented milk daily. Full-cream milk under the same conditions gave an increase of 522%. Cultivation without agitation resulted in 175% and 173% increases for low-fat and full-cream milk, respectively.
