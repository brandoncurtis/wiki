## Upgraded Soylent (via Brandon)

Soylent drink 2.0 is $2.70 for 400 kcal of shelf-stable tastelessness.  My goal was to upgrade this, using ingredients that I would feel good about eating,

| Ingredient | Mass | Volume | Calories | f:c:p |
|------------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| soy protein isolate | 13g | 2 scoops | 50 | 1:0:11 |
| nonfat dry milk | 17g | 2 scoops | 60 | 0:9:6 |
| coconut oil | 30g | 2 scoops | 250 | 30:0:0 |
| **ADDED** | **60g** | ----- | **360** | 31:9:17 |
| Soylent   | -----   | 1 bottle | 400  | 21:37:20 |
| **TOTAL** | -----   | ----- | **760** | 52:46:37 |

## Homemade Shake (via Jacob)

### Ingredients

"I never use this as a meal replacement, but it's a good ~3-4 pm snack, especially on climbing days!"

| Ingredient | Mass | Volume |
|------------|------|--------|
| Casein     | 18g  | ~3 TBsp|
| Whey       | 6g   | ~1 TBsp|
| Sprouted Oat Flour | 28g | ~4 TBsp |
| Ground Chia Seeds | 19g | 1 scoop |
| Matcha | 2g | ~1 tsp |

71 g total mass, 298 g total calories (9g fat, 25 g carbs, 30 g protein)

Cost: $1.00 per serving ($1.13 w/Matcha)

| Source | Protein | Fraction |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Casein | 16g     | 51 %     |
| Whey   | 5g      | 18 %     |
| Oat    | 6g      | 18 %     |
| Chia   | 4g      | 13 %     |


### Batch Prep

Sprouted oats: 300g raw oats -->soak for 6+ hours, drain and sprout for ~2-3 days, rinsing 2-3 times a day. dehydrate for ~12hrs. usually makes ~275g sprouts.

I grind the oats in two stages: (1) low speed (increasing slowly) until fairly homogeneous course grind achieved --> high speed for ~30 sec, then let cool (~45 min?). (2) High speed again for ~30 sec.

I grind the chia seeds with the whey protein (helps lessen the clumping of the chia): low speed increasing slowly until course grind, then high speed for ~30s

In large bowl (I use the old ice cream container), mix the oat flour and chia/whey. I use a whisk to help get rid of the clumps. mix in casein powder. Finally, blend the final mixture on medium speed to get rid of any remaining clumps (usually in 3 batches due to large volume).

Typical ~10-serving batch prep:

| Ingredient | Mass |
|------------|------|
| Oats       | 275 g|
| Chia       | 185 g|
| Casein     | 175 g|
| Whey       | 60  g|
