Buffer Tables
-------------

[Good's Buffers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good's_buffers) are a list of 20 buffering agents that are easy to make, stable, biologically compatible, and active in the typical biological pH range of 6-8.

Berkeley Microscopy has [tables of common buffer formulations](http://microscopy.berkeley.edu/Resources/instruction/buffers.html) from *Ruzin, 1999 Plant Microtechnique and Microscopy*.

Sigma-Aldrich also has a [table of buffers commonly used in the life sciences](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/core-bioreagents/biological-buffers/learning-center/buffer-reference-center.html).
