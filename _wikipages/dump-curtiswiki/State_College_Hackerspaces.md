MakeSpace
---------

<http://makespace.io/>

Solder, 3D printer, band saw, lots of odds and ends but nothing substantial.

Some very casual meetups...sometimes recorded live on videofeed...other times not (for confidentiality).

An example of upcoming meetups:

-   Monday--lecture on bitcoin
-   Tuesday--discussion group (wide range of topics i.e. science, technology, policy, philosophy). Most recent was gaming; next week is AI.
-   Wednesday--open house/3D printing

Other occasional workshops, very informal. Some ongoing projects...[GreenTowers](http://www.greentowersusa.com/portfolio/furniture/) used the space.

They used to be partnered with [InnoBlue](http://www.innoblue.org/about.html) but they decided to move back to campus---so I think that 'divorce' is in part responsible for the organizational vacuum.

Designed as a 'community space' but no (or at least very limited) incentive for the community to ever come to the space simultaneously... setup more like a subscription-based workshop than a community space.

Ultimately, a lot of potential waiting to be tapped... good platform to test a more flat organizational dynamic.
