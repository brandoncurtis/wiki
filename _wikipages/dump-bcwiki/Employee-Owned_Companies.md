"The employee-owned company has been named one of the Best Places to Work in Vermont every year since the inception of the award in 2006."

"They started with a 30 percent chunk of the company, then another 40 percent, and by 2004 the company was 100 percent employee-owned through a legal trust called an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)."
