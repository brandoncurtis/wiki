Resource Utilization: Ubuntu 10.04 vs 12.04
-------------------------------------------

"I was going to suggest XFCE. If it's good enough for a pissed off Linus Torvalds, then it's good enough for you. Or you could try LXDE actually. I mean, you would have to put real effort into going on Ebay, and really search and hunt for a computer low powered enough that LXDE won't work. I mean LXDE is light, and good looking too. With the Ambiance and Radiance themes, it really does look as good as Gnome 2."
