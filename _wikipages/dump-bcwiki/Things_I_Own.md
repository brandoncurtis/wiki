### Flatwear

Currently a big mess of random junk (and one really nice stolen Reed & Barton 18/10 stainless spoon).

My parents always had decent [Oneida 'Flight'](http://www.silversuperstore.com/oneida/flight.html) 18/10 stainless; Oneida ditched its US manufacturing in 2005, and my parents' design is one that's now only available in 18/0 from China. The ['Moda'](http://www.silversuperstore.com/oneida/moda.html), ['Lagen'](http://www.silversuperstore.com/oneida/lagen-silverware.html), and other designs are still available 18/10, but it's all from China. I don't think so.

[Steel quality](http://www.silversuperstore.com/stainless_quality.html) is important. I'd like to buy American, 18/10 stainless, heavy enough to withstand ice cream scooping, in a simple unadorned design that's easy to clean. This is a tall order, but I found a match: [Revolution flatware](http://www.silversuperstore.com/revolution/flatware.html), manufactured with Sherrill steel in [central New York](http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/silverware_maker_brings_manufacturing_back_from_mexico_more_than_doubles_cny_wor.html). Silver Superstore (an online retailer based in Kent, WA) was actually [responsible for helping this US manufacturer out of bankruptcy](http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/sherrill_manufacturing_resumes_1.html), so I'll be buying from them!
