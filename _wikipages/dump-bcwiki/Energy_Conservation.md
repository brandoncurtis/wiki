Our electricity provider is Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). In July 2014, we switched our electricity rate plan from a constant 13-14 cents/kWh to a time-of-usage–based plan: <http://www.pge.com/en/myhome/saveenergymoney/plans/tou/index.page>

I tried to sign up (1-866-743-0263) for: Time-of-Use + SmartRate (E6-Smart) on June 23. It looks like the SmartRate add-on didn't go through in time for July—they only signed me up for E6!
