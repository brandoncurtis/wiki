Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform
-----------------------------

In **2014**, civil forfeiture reform legislation was proposed in the house:
[H.R. 5212 (113th): Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2014](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr5212) initially by Tim Walberg and then resubmitted as [H.R. 5502 (113th): FAIR Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr5502) by Scott Garrett.

In the senate:
[S. 2644 (113th): Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration (FAIR) Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s2644) by [Rand Paul](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/07/25/rand-paul-introduces-bill-to-reform-civil-asset-forfeiture/).

These bills died in the 2014 Congress.

In **2015**, Rand Paul and Tim Walberg reintroduced the FAIR Act as [S. 255](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s255) and [H.R. 540](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr540).

Attorney General Holder also weighed in : [Prohibition on Certain Federal Adoptions of Seizures by State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/01/16/attorney_general_order_prohibiting_adoptions.pdf). This is a change in policy on the federal level, but it doesn't stop abuses on the state level. The House Judiciary subcommittee [agreed that reform legislation is necessary](http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/lawmakers-say-abuses-of-civil-asset-forfeiture-require-reform-legislation/2015/02/11/f5c27714-b21e-11e4-886b-c22184f27c35_story.html).
