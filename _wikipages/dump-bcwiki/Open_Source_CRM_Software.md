If your project starts to grow so large and complicated that you can no longer keep track of all of your clients in a simple spreadsheet, it may be time to upgrade to Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software.

The packages available from Oracle, SalesForce, and Microsoft are bloated and costly. Choose an open source CRM that's free and has the features that you need!

For my technical and financial consulting project, I use a heavily customized SuiteCRM install.
