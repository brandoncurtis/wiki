    CHAPTER 2: LIGHT AND LIGHT COMMUNICATION

    LEDs can be used as narrow-band optical detectors!
    Water absorbs strongly at 940nm, but not at 880nm
    sensitivity, rise time of phototransistors?

    Look for AMP fiber connectors
    Look for Motorolla detectors that attach to AMP connectors (MFOD 102F/302F)
    FIber can be inserted directly into LEDs with a hot awl, heatshrink, and epoxy
    PIN photodiodes are best for high frequency operation
    Photodiodes are faster; phototransistors are more sensitive

    CHAPTER 6: DIGITAL CIRCUITS

    Phase-locked loops
    Emitter-Coupled Logic (ECL) can be used to create high-speed oscillators (~100MHz)
