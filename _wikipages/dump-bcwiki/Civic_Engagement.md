Voting
------

You can always drop off your vote-by-mail ballot at the polling place! You can also register for vote-by-mail online: <https://www.acgov.org/alco_ssl_app/rov/voter_info/voter_profile.jsp?formLanguage=E>

And if you want enough "I Voted" stickers (in five languages) for the rest of your life, just volunteer at the polls: <http://www.acgov.org/rov/workers.htm>

Well that sucks, because there were a lot of important things on the ballet, especially with respect to local Measures and state Propositions!

To prevent this sad state of affairs from reoccurring, sign up for Vote-By-Mail by logging in here: <https://www.acgov.org/alco_ssl_app/rov/voter_info/voter_profile.jsp?formLanguage=E> or by filling out and mailing this form: <http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/vote-by-mail/pdf/fill-in-vote-by-mail-app-instruct.pdf>

Don't know if you're registered? Log in above and you can check. If you find you're not, you can register online right here: <http://www.acgov.org/rov/registration.htm>

You'll receive your ballot a couple weeks before the election, and you can research the issues and fill it out at your leisure. Then, mail it in before the deadline a few days before the election or drop it off at any polling place in the county on election dayâ€”no waiting in line.
