OA Routes and Strategies

I've made a tool that takes a list of journal titles and returns their OA status in a .CSV file: <http://flask.brandoncurtis.com>

OA Cost Subsidies
-----------------

Berkeley participates in a program to subsidize OA costs: [Berkeley Research Impact Initiative (BRII)](http://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/brii).

"One application per individual per calendar year. Article processing charges (APCs) will be subsidized for fully open access journals only (that is, the entire journal must be freely available to the public and not charge a subscription fee). BRII will fund up to $3000 of APC. Please note that BRII no longer covers APCs for "hybrid" (subscription-based) journals. We request that authors or publishers with sufficient funding from grants or contracts not apply for BRII funds. We encourage researchers to include a line-item on future grant proposals for dissemination or open access costs. If possible, we ask that BRII funding recipients include the following statement in their acknowledgements: Publication made possible in part by support from the Berkeley Research Impact Initative (BRII) sponsored by the UC Berkeley Library."
