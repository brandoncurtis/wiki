Really Cool Proteins
--------------------

[Magainin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magainin) - a class of antimicrobial proteins that form part of the frog's innate immune system.

[Resilin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilin) - an elastomeric protein with incredible mechanical energy storage capabilities. Found in the connective tissue of insects, resilin has an elastic energy storage efficiency of 95%+ and allows fleas and grasshoppers to jump incredible distances and flies to pivot their wings in amazing ways.

Biofuels
