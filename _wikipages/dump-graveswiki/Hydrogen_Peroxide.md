Quantification
--------------

For measuring of concentration of H2O2 we used Titanium(IV) oxysulfate solution. The principle of this method is that titan ions react with H2O2 and the pertitanic acid is created: Ti4+ + H2O2 + 2 H2O â†’ TiO2. H2O2 + 4 H+

It is a yellow colored product. We can measure the absorbance at 407 nm of this product and then determine the concentration of H2O2.
