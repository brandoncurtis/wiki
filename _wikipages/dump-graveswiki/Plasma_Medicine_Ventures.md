Plasma Disinfection
-------------------

I'm not sure if anyone is familiar with Stephen Daniels from the Irish National Centre for Plasma Science and Technology, but it turns out he has a company, Novaerus, that makes cold plasma air purifiers (using SMDs) intended for hospitals. My dad works in the healthcare industry and came across Novearus at a conference a couple of weeks ago.

This is interesting to me for a few reasons--I didn't know that anyone was commercializing plasma disinfection devices (other than the KinPen), and I hadn't heard of Stephen Daniels before.

Here's their website if you'd like to take a look: <http://www.novaerus.com/>
