        Hey Brandon,
        Here's the best software I found:
        Qucs: Can publish circuit schematic as well as test circuits during design.
        XCircuit: Solely for drawing publishable circuits
        Electric: Schematic publishing and circuit testing, handles integrated circuits in a different and possibly better way than most other software (wikipedia article sounds heavily biased and I don't know enough about circuit design to have an informed opinion).
