Thermal Measurement Hardware
----------------------------

In summary:

-   Thermistors (NTC): best for measurement at moderate temperatures, from -90C to 130C
-   Thermocouples: best for measurements at very high temperatures, from 500C to 2320C
-   RTDs: best for very low (-200C to -90C) and moderately high (130C to 500C) temperatures

### Resistance Temperature Detector

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_Temperature_Detector>

aka ‘RTD’, 'Resistance Thermometer', 'Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT)

> "Most RTD elements consist of a length of fine coiled wire wrapped around a ceramic or glass core. The RTD element is made from a pure material whose resistance at various temperatures has been documented."

> "They are slowly replacing the use of thermocouples in many industrial applications below 600 °C, due to higher accuracy and repeatability."

### Thermocouples

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple>

> "A thermocouple is a device consisting of two different conductors (usually metal alloys) that produce a voltage, proportional to a temperature difference, between either end of the two conductors."

> "...thermocouples are self powered and require no external form of excitation."

### Thermistor

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor>

> "A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance varies significantly with temperature, more so than in standard resistors."

A thermistor may have positive thermal coefficient (PTC), in which case resistance increases with temperature, or a negative thermal coefficient (NTC).

> "Many NTC thermistors are made from a pressed disc or cast chip of a semiconductor such as a sintered metal oxide. They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of electrons able to move about and carry charge - it promotes them into the conduction band. The more charge carriers that are available, the more current a material can conduct."

> "Most PTC thermistors are of the "switching" type, which means that their resistance rises suddenly at a certain critical temperature."

### RTDs vs Thermocouples

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_Temperature_Detector#RTDs_vs_Thermocouples>

> "If process temperatures are between -200 to 500 °C (-328 to 932 °F), an industrial RTD is the preferred option. Thermocouples have a range of -180 to 2,320 °C (-292 to 4,208 °F), so for temperatures above 500 °C (932 °F) they are the only contact temperature measurement device."

> "If a tolerance of 2 °C is acceptable and the highest level of repeatability is not required, a thermocouple will serve. RTDs are capable of higher accuracy and can maintain stability for many years, while thermocouples can drift within the first few hours of use."

> "If the process requires a very fast response to temperature changes—fractions of a second as opposed to seconds (e.g. 2.5 to 10 s)—then a thermocouple is the best choice."

### RTDs vs Thermistors

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor>

> "Thermistors differ from resistance temperature detectors (RTD) in that the material used in a thermistor is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while thermistors typically achieve a higher precision within a limited temperature range, typically −90 °C to 130 °C."
