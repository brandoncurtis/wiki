Whether or not you're reimbursed, some of your job-related moving expenses may be tax-deductible!

Reimbursement Methods
---------------------

If your employer pays the movers directly, the expenses are excludable from income: they won't show up anywhere on your W-2, and you'll owe no tax on them.

If your employer reimburses you for specific relocation expenses, taxes will be withheld and the reimbursement will appear in Form W-2 Box 12 (NOT Box 1) along with the code 'P'. You will not owe tax on the tax-deductible portion of this reimbursement, so this will either reduce your taxes owed or increase the size of your refund.

If you are provided with a lump-sum reimbursement amount, you have to determine what is tax-deductible and do an extra form:

> "Should you receive a lump sum payment for moving expenses, you are entitled to deduct your actual costs for household goods move, travel, and lodging as part of your final move, on IRS Form 3903, since the entire amount of the lump sum payment is reported as wages in Box 1 of your W-2."
