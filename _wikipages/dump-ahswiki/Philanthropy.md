Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

> Wikipedia, because it is a useful project to have around. Humble Bundle, because if I'm going to buy games anyway, I might as well have some portion of that money go to charity. Smile.Amazon.com, because it costs me nothing to do so.
>
> It's not really a donation but i loan on kiva. And i give Wikipedia money when they fundraise because it has taught me everything i know.
>
> The American Red Cross is a good organization that does a lot of different things. They even helped my grandmother locate her mother after Mount St. Helens erupted.
>
> To answer my own question: local, regional, and state cycling advocacy groups. These groups have made impressive progress in improving this country's shameful cycling and pedestrian infrastructure over the last decade. (I loan on Kiva.org as well, however you want to think about that)
>
> Army Emergency Relief. A few bucks out of each paycheck automatically.
>
> Thon!
>
> I had never heard of kiva before! That is wonderful!
>
> Planned Parenthood. I've gotten thousands of dollars of care from them for free. The least I can do is donate when I have it
>
> Why do you ask? Are you looking for a new cause, or just a survey? B/c if you are looking for a new cause, look on charity navigators. They have a reputable org for pretty much whatever strikes your fancy.
>
> As many of you have experienced firsthand, I've been running with the personal finance banner for a couple years now. I've had many requests to talk about the philosophy, economics, and best practices of philanthropy.
>
> I have a process for these projects: I distill conclusions from the data and observe them through the lens of my perspectives on ethics and utility. Before I get started, I wanted to hear what other people are doing and why they're doing it.
>
> Local food bank, local library, American Cancer Society, Red Cross, multiple sclerosis society, local fire company, npr, and our church. I've always wondered if it better to give a smaller amount to a large number of charities, or a larger amount to a small number of charities.
>
> This year I've donated to Lucie's Place, Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, the It Gets Better Project, so far. I donate to charities that have A or higher ratings with minimal religious/political involvement. Especially causes that I feel are overlooked or actively fought against by the general public.
>
> If you want to know the why, I know one of the reasons I donate to the United Way because it's convenient. It's pretty effective when a charity comes to your office and says, "Here, fill this out and you'll never even miss the money when it comes out of your check."
>
> ACLU
>
> Wikipedia. I ain't got a lot of cash to donate, but the free knowledge stuff is a huge deal in my book and I use it constantly.
>
> Local things. Donated a bunch of gifts for orphans in my city through a locally organized event and volunteered some time in other minor fundraising stuff for them. Also requested my family to send any cash they would like Christmas to my friend's donation page since she's just discovered her cancer came back and can't afford the bills to survive and I, thankfully, have no need for it. I don't like donating unless I'm able to see how it goes through the system transparently and am aware of the results. I used to donate time but this year I've actually some income so I help a bit in other ways since I haven't got time anymore. Small scale, local, clear goals. I used to be on a career path towards working in NGOs, so I've done enough research and heard stories about the big ones enough to be turned off monetarily funding most of them for life.
>
> I remember you sharing something from Crash Course. They have a Subbable if you want to support them. I donate $5 a month.
>
> I don't currently contribute, but this is up for consideration in my annual financial review. What is your perspective on the relative utility of philanthropy versus saving and investing at the early career stage? This is on my shortlist of things to think about.
>
> Well, obviously I could maximize investment with my income and cut out any philanthropy. This would be acceptable considering my net worth isn't that high. My philanthropy is only $25 a month though, which is a very small fraction of my monthly post-tax income saved. This won’t impede early retirement by much.
>
> Additionally, stuff like Crash Course makes you think about important things in a reasonable way, particularly REALLY important stuff like climate change and overpopulation. Beyond that, they do it with cute and funny videos that make the issues more accessible. The way our society currently thinks about these issues is so divorced from reality that I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that it is threatening humankind, and anything that alleviates that ignorance is worthwhile.
>
> In particular, this lecture from a respected researcher pretty much has me doubting whether or not there will even be an economy around when I try to access my Roth IRA funds. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RInrvSjW90U> He is saying we can hit 4 degrees Celsius by 2050, a temperature most climate scientists who study the effects of climate change think is incompatible with organized global activity.
>
> With issues like these being completely mishandled, I actually view philanthropy that attempts to right these misconceptions to be a form of personal investment insurance.
>
> Heres a solution. Don't pay for any corporate movie, TV, muzak and textbooks (stream, pirate, public) and split the savings with Crash course. The fact that crash course allows consumption without payment makes them more deserving. Their independence is unique and valuable. Its not Texas Textbook history. Any understanding of law, politics, society should be grounded in world and national history. They're good entertainment. I'm watching several daily (no cable or even netflix) . But, look at how 25$ goes any other way of education. Thats like a few minutes of lecture time at a private university, 0.4-1.2% of public school spending per student (Utah-NY). And unlike local tax money, its democratic. Education is fucked in america. Charities a horrible substitute for justice, but I feel a little better about the future knowing theres resources for people deprived engaging, talented educators.
>
> Exactly. American capitalism is built on unnecessary consumption. Consume less, and make that consumption more meaningful, or humanity doesn't have much of a shot of a livable climate. To me, Crash Course also demonstrates you can have great entertainment that is edifying and free for all. That's worth paying for.
