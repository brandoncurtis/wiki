On 401(k)s and Tax Arbitrage
----------------------------

Asset Location – Bonds Go In Taxable! via: <http://whitecoatinvestor.com/asset-location-bonds-go-in-taxable/>

"There is also the possibility of a tax arbitrage. If you contribute at a 33% marginal tax rate, but withdraw the money at a 17% effective tax rate, you get an additional significant benefit out of the 401K. Obviously, the arbitrage CAN be negative, but that’s pretty unlikely for most doctors, even with a rise in marginal tax rates. More details on calculating the benefit of retirement accounts can be found in my recent post on the value of a 401K."
