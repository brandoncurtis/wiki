'The Oven Trick'
----------------

### Principle

By heating your electronic device in the oven, you can partially melt and 'reflow' the solder to fix faulty connections. This has a high rate of success for broken video cards and sticks of RAM!

### Personal Experience

On 2014.05.16, I baked four sticks of DDR2 RAM in a conventional oven at 425F for 9 minutes. One of the four sticks regained full functionality!

On 2014.05.19, I baked the remaining three sticks in a conventional oven at 500F for 9 minutes. Two additional sticks regained full functionality!

In total, 6GB of DDRII RAM was recovered with this technique.
