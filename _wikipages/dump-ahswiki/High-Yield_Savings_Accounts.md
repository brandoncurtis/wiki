"After all said and done, taking into account the initial $5,000 plus a $5 per month deposit and the $3 monthly fee, you end up getting a 5.2% yield. That’s $260/year with the Mango card compared to $50/year if you leave your $5,000 and the $5/month in a regular “high yield” savings account that pays 1%."

"Earn up to 5.10% APY with our High-Yield Savings Account"

"The APY advertised applies only to the portion of your savings account balance, which is $5,000.00 or less; or 2.00% if you are not on Direct Deposit. An APY of 0.10% will be paid on the portion of your savings account balance that exceeds $5,000.00."

"Union Plus Prepaid Card: 5% Savings Account FDIC Insured

If you liked Mango Prepaid card with its 6% savings account (4.6% after taking into account idle cash) but you wished you could put in more than $5,000, here’s another one that does pretty much the same thing.

It’s called Union Plus prepaid debit card. It’s run by the same parent company as Mango, just marketed through a different channel with a slightly different configuration."

"Like Mango, you open the savings account after you get the prepaid card. The savings account pays 5.1% APY for balance up to $5,000. Balance over $5,000 earns 0.1%. You must have recurring deposit into the card in order to keep the 5.1% rate on the savings account. I’m not clear how much in recurring deposit is needed but $50/month will probably do, as in Mango."
