For the official domestic numbers, check out the EIA's [Annual Energy Outlook](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/).

In 2012, total domestic energy consumption was **~95 quadrillion BTUs**.

Food
----

Food appears to take up about **16%** of our total domestic energy usage.

via [USDA 2010 Report on Energy Use in the U.S. Food System](http://dusp.mit.edu/sites/all/files/attachments/project/Energy_in_Food_System.pdf):

> A projection of food-related energy use based on 2007 total U.S. energy consumption and food expenditure data and the benchmark 2002 input-output accounts suggests that food-related energy use as a share of the national energy budget grew from 14.4 percent in 2002 to an estimated 15.7 percent in 2007.

Transportation
--------------

Transportation appears to take up about **27%** of our total domestic energy consumption.
