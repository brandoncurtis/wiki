<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_milk>

"Soy milk can be made from whole soybeans or full-fat soy flour. The dry beans are soaked in water overnight or for a minimum of 3 hours or more depending on the temperature of the water. The rehydrated beans then undergo wet grinding with enough added water to give the desired solids content to the final product. The ratio of water to beans on a weight basis should be about 10:1. The resulting slurry or purée is brought to a boil in order to improve its nutritional value by heat inactivating soybean trypsin inhibitor, improve its flavor and to sterilize the product. Heating at or near the boiling point is continued for a period of time, 15–20 minutes, followed by the removal of an insoluble residue (soy pulp fiber or okara) by filtration."

"There is a simple yet important difference between traditional Chinese and Japanese soy milk processing: the Chinese method boils the filtrate (soy milk) after a cold filtration, while the Japanese method boils the slurry first, followed by hot filtration of the slurry. The latter method results in a higher yield of soy milk but requires the use of an anti-foaming agent or natural defoamer during the boiling step. Bringing filtered soy milk to a boil avoids the problem of foaming."

1.  soak beans
2.  blend
3.  strain
4.  boil
5.  flavor

"I have seen other recipes that recommend using the paste to augment other foods. One says to make some kind of Korean bean pancake thing with it. I am sure there are other uses."

Also involves a cooking step

"Keep the okara (also called soy pulp) which is packed with protein and filled with fiber, for your next batch of breakfast muffins, okara chocolate cake, or okara seitan."

This recipe cooks the beans first.

"Eventually, you'll be left with some soy paste, which you can add to Korean pancakes (bin dae duk), or even to smoothies for extra protein content." <http://drbenkim.com/bin-dae-duk-korean-pancake-recipe.htm>

### Improving The Taste

-   Add salt, sugar/honey, vanilla
-   try steaming the beans first! (someone said this is how Silk does it)
-   soak a LOT, and start the soak in boiling water!
-   cook after blending!
-   cook a LOT
-   try adding cooked brown rice, oats, etc

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_milk>

"In 1969, Mattick and Hand at Cornell University made the important discovery that most of the so-called beany flavor in soybeans was not inherent in the beans themselves but was produced by the enzyme lipoxygenase when the split beans came in contact with water. Lipoxygenase could be inactivated and most of the beany flavor removed by either dropping unsoaked soybeans directly into boiling water or by removing any cracked or split beans prior to soaking, then carefully dropping the soaked beans into boiling water."

Use the okara in veggie burgers! "The okara also goes well beaten with an egg and fried like a pancake!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<http://allthatveganjazz.blogspot.com/2009/01/much-much-better-homemade-soy-milk.html>

"The taste problem arises in the soaking. The sour, beany taste comes from an activated enzyme - a trypsin inhibitor called lipoxygenase - that is activated when the dry beans interact with moisture. However, if the pH level and temperature are above normal, the enzyme is not activated."

"Lipoxygenase isozymes, responsible for the off-flavour associated with soy-based foods, and trypsin inhibitor, that affects protein digestibility, are two undesirable biological components present in soybean."
