Sharing Books
-------------

### Goodreads

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) has an excellent app for quickly adding your books to your library by scanning their ISBN barcodes with your phone camera:

-   <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodreads&hl=en>
-   <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreads-book-recommendations/id355833469?mt=8>

### Lenro

[Lenro](https://lenro.co/) will import your Goodreads library and list them for lending. You can search by zipcode for books to borrow in your area!

For example, here is [my library in Lenro](https://lenro.co/users/brandon-curtis).
