### Tomato Diseases

[1](http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/tompests/msg0422074424271.html?5) "One of the diseases that can cause specific spots on the stems is pretty much only found in CA and it's called Alternaria Stem Canker."

[2](http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r783101311.html) "Alternaria stem canker is primarily a problem of coastal-grown tomatoes in California although the disease occurs occasionally in other areas of the state in fields planted with infested transplants. The fungus survives on infected tomato debris. Infection occurs when airborne spores land on tomato plants or when plants come in contact with infested soil. Free water is necessary for spore germination and infection. Disease spread is favored by rains, dew, and overhead irrigation. Symptoms develop 7 to 10 days after inoculation and develop most rapidly at temperatures of around 77°F (25°C)."

"Planting tomatoes in cold soil may cause the leaves to turn purple from a lack of potassium because tomatoes cannot absorb potassium if the soil is too cold"

### Fertilizing Tomatoes

<http://www.gardensalive.com/article.asp?ai=1113>

Fertilizer numbers: N-P-K (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium)

"Studies have found that the ideal ratio of those nutrients for flowering plants is 3-1-2. (That’s 3% Nitrogen, 1% phosphorus & 2% potassium.) So look for that ratio on the label of packaged fertilizers; anything close to a 3-1-2, a 6-2-4 or a 9-3-6 should be ideal."

### Preventing Herbs from Bolting

'Bolting' is when a vegetable flowers and goes to seed. In most cases, this is a negative thing and associated with a drastic decrease in the plant's productivity.
